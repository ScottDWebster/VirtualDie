# VirtualDie

This is a simple programming exercise I decided to undertake as programming practise.  The idea came to mind after watching YouTuber Docm77 [create a dice gambling game in Minecraft.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF5Xjflb2Cg)

Press either the A or B button on the Micro:bit and it will display a randomly chosen die face representing one of the six sides of a die.
