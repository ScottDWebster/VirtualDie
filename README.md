# VirtualDie

This is a simple programming exercise I decided to undertake as programming practice.  The idea came to mind after watching YouTuber Docm77 [create a dice gambling game in Minecraft.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF5Xjflb2Cg)

Press the A button on the Micro:bit and it will "roll" (display a randomly chosen die face representing one of the six sides of a die).
Or if you have one or more additional microbits available, load the program on all of them and press the B button on one to send a command to the others that will cause them to "roll" as well as the one on which the button was pressed.
